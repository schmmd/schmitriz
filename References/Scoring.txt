The Tetris scoring is based on the scoring for the Macintosh version,
which I derived (hopefully accurately) by observing the Mac closely.

  score per piece = 5 + (2 * level) + height of piece

where height of piece is defined as

  a.) the height of the piece when you dropped it
  b.) the height of the piece when it landed if you didn't drop it

If the next piece feature is on, subtract

  level/2 + 2

from that score. There are no additional points for eliminating rows.
